       *  @brief  Extracting from another streambuf.
       *  @param  __sb  A pointer to a streambuf
       *
       *  This function behaves like one of the basic arithmetic extractors,
       *  in that it also constructs a sentry object and has the same error
       *  handling behavior.
       *
       *  If @p __sb is NULL, the stream will set failbit in its error state.
       *
       *  Characters are extracted from @p __sb and inserted into @c *this
       *  until one of the following occurs:
       *
       *  - the input stream reaches end-of-file,
       *  - insertion into the output sequence fails (in this case, the
       *    character that would have been inserted is not extracted), or
       *  - an exception occurs while getting a character from @p __sb, which
       *    sets failbit in the error state
       *
       *  If the function inserts no characters, failbit is set.

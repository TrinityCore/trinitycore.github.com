<doc f='TrinityCore3.3.5/dep/g3dlite/include/G3D/Log.h' l='23'>/** Prints to the common system log, log.txt, which is usually 
    in the working directory of the program.  If your disk is 
    not writable or is slow, it will attempt to write to &quot;c:/tmp/log.txt&quot; or
     &quot;c:/temp/log.txt&quot; on Windows systems instead. 

    Unlike printf or debugPrintf, 
    this function guarantees that all output is committed before it returns.
    This is very useful for debugging a crash, which might hide the last few
    buffered print statements otherwise.

    Many G3D routines write useful warnings and debugging information to the
    system log, which makes it a good first place to go when tracking down
    a problem.

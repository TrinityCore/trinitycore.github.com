   * This function sets the expiry time. Any pending asynchronous wait
   * operations will be cancelled. The handler for each cancelled operation will
   * be invoked with the boost::asio::error::operation_aborted error code.
   *
   * @param expiry_time The expiry time to be used for the timer.
   *
   * @return The number of asynchronous operations that were cancelled.
   *
   * @throws boost::system::system_error Thrown on failure.
   *
   * @note If the timer has already expired when expires_at() is called, then
   * the handlers for asynchronous wait operations will:
   *
   * @li have already been invoked; or
   *
   * @li have been queued for invocation in the near future.
   *
   * These handlers can no longer be cancelled, and therefore are passed an
   * error code that indicates the successful completion of the wait operation.

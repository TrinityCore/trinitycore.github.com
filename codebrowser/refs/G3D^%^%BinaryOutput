 Sequential or random access byte-order independent binary file access.

 The compress() call can be used to compress with zlib.

 Any method call can trigger an out of memory error (thrown as char*) 
 when writing to &quot;&lt;memory&gt;&quot; instead of a file.

 Compressed writing and seeking backwards is not supported for huge files
 (i.e., BinaryOutput may have to dump the contents to disk if they 
 exceed available RAM).

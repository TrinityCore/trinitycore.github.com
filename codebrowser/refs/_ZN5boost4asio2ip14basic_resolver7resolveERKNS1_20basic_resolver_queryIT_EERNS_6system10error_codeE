   * This function is used to resolve a query into a list of endpoint entries.
   *
   * @param q A query object that determines what endpoints will be returned.
   *
   * @param ec Set to indicate what error occurred, if any.
   *
   * @returns A forward-only iterator that can be used to traverse the list
   * of endpoint entries. Returns a default constructed iterator if an error
   * occurs.
   *
   * @note A default constructed iterator represents the end of the list.
   *
   * A successful call to this function is guaranteed to return at least one
   * entry.

   * This function is used to retrieve the non-blocking mode of the underlying
   * native acceptor. This mode has no effect on the behaviour of the acceptor
   * object&apos;s synchronous operations.
   *
   * @returns @c true if the underlying acceptor is in non-blocking mode and
   * direct system calls may fail with boost::asio::error::would_block (or the
   * equivalent system error).
   *
   * @note The current non-blocking mode is cached by the acceptor object.
   * Consequently, the return value may be incorrect if the non-blocking mode
   * was set directly on the native acceptor.

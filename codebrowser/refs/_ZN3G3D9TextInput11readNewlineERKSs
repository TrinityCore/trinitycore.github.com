        WrongString.  If the next token in the input is a newline matching @p
        s, it will be consumed.

        Use this method if you want to match a specific newline from the
        input.  In that case, typically error reporting related to the token
        is only going to occur because of a mismatch, so no location
        information is needed by the caller.

        WrongTokenType will be thrown if the next token in the input stream
        is not a newline.  WrongString will be thrown if the next token in the
        input stream is a newlin but does not match the @p s parameter.  When
        an exception is thrown, no tokens are consumed.

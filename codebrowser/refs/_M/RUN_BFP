 * RUN_MAX_OVRHD indicates maximum desired run header overhead.  Runs are sized
 * as small as possible such that this setting is still honored, without
 * violating other constraints.  The goal is to make runs as small as possible
 * without exceeding a per run external fragmentation threshold.
 *
 * We use binary fixed point math for overhead computations, where the binary
 * point is implicitly RUN_BFP bits to the left.
 *
 * Note that it is possible to set RUN_MAX_OVRHD low enough that it cannot be
 * honored for some/all object sizes, since when heap profiling is enabled
 * there is one pointer of header overhead per object (plus a constant).  This
 * constraint is relaxed (ignored) for runs that are so small that the
 * per-region overhead is greater than:
 *
 *   (RUN_MAX_OVRHD / (reg_interval &lt;&lt; (3+RUN_BFP))

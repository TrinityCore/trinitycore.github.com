<doc f='TrinityCore3.3.5/dep/g3dlite/include/G3D/Random.h' l='21'>/** Random number generator.

    Threadsafe.

    Useful for generating consistent random numbers across platforms
    and when multiple threads are involved.

    Uses the Fast Mersenne Twister (FMT-19937) algorithm.

    On average, uniform() runs about 2x-3x faster than rand().

    On OS X, Random is about 10x faster than drand48() (which is
    threadsafe) and 4x faster than rand() (which is not threadsafe).

   The only complicated aspect of the battle is Finger of Death and Doomfire, with Doomfire being the
   hardest bit to code. Finger of Death is simply a distance check - if no one is in melee range, then
   select a random target and cast the spell on them. However, if someone IS in melee range, and this
   is NOT the main tank (creature&apos;s victim), then we aggro that player and they become the new victim.
   For Doomfire, we summon a mob (Doomfire Spirit) for the Doomfire mob to follow. It&apos;s spirit will
   randomly select it&apos;s target to follow and then we create the random movement making it unpredictable. */</doc>

 * The work class is used to inform the io_service when work starts and
 * finishes. This ensures that the io_service object&apos;s run() function will not
 * exit while work is underway, and that it does exit when there is no
 * unfinished work remaining.
 *
 * The work class is copy-constructible so that it may be used as a data member
 * in a handler class. It is not assignable.

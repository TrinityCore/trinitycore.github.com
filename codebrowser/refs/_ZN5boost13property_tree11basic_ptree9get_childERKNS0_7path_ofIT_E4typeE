         * @note Depending on the path, the result at each level may not be
         *       completely determinate, i.e. if the same key appears multiple
         *       times, which child is chosen is not specified. This can lead
         *       to the path not being resolved even though there is a
         *       descendant with this path. Example:
         * @code
         *   a -&gt; b -&gt; c
         *     -&gt; b
         * @endcode
         *       The path &quot;a.b.c&quot; will succeed if the resolution of &quot;b&quot; chooses
         *       the first such node, but fail if it chooses the second.

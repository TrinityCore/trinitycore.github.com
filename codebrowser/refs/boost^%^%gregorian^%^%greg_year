<doc f='include/boost/date_time/gregorian/greg_year.hpp' l='33'>/*! This small class allows for simple conversion an integer value into
      a year for the gregorian calendar.  This currently only allows a
      range of 1900 to 10000.  Both ends of the range are a bit arbitrary
      at the moment, but they are the limits of current testing of the 
      library.  As such they may be increased in the future.

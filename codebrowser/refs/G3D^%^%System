 @brief OS and processor abstraction.  

 The first time any method is called the processor will be analyzed.
 Future calls are then fast.

 Timing function overview:
    System::getCycleCount
      - actual cycle count

    System::getTick
      - High-resolution time in seconds since program started

    System::getLocalTime
      - High-resolution time in seconds since Jan 1, 1970
        (because it is stored in a double, this may be less
         accurate than getTick)

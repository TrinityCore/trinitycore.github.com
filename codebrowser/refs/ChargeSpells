    Charge spells can be classified in four groups:

        - Spells on vehicle bar used by players:
            + EFFECT_0: SCRIPT_EFFECT
            + EFFECT_1: TRIGGER_SPELL
            + EFFECT_2: NONE
        - Spells cast by player&apos;s mounts triggered by script:
            + EFFECT_0: CHARGE
            + EFFECT_1: TRIGGER_SPELL
            + EFFECT_2: APPLY_AURA
        - Spells cast by players on the target triggered by script:
            + EFFECT_0: SCHOOL_DAMAGE
            + EFFECT_1: SCRIPT_EFFECT
            + EFFECT_2: NONE
        - Spells cast by NPCs on players:
            + EFFECT_0: SCHOOL_DAMAGE
            + EFFECT_1: CHARGE
            + EFFECT_2: SCRIPT_EFFECT

    In the following script we handle the SCRIPT_EFFECT and CHARGE
        - When handling SCRIPT_EFFECT:
            + EFFECT_0: Corresponds to &quot;Spells on vehicle bar used by players&quot; and we make player&apos;s mount cast
              the charge effect on the current target (&quot;Spells cast by player&apos;s mounts triggered by script&quot;).
            + EFFECT_1 and EFFECT_2: Triggered when &quot;Spells cast by player&apos;s mounts triggered by script&quot; hits target,
              corresponding to &quot;Spells cast by players on the target triggered by script&quot; and &quot;Spells cast by
              NPCs on players&quot; and we check Defend layers and drop a charge of the first found.
        - When handling CHARGE:
            + Only launched for &quot;Spells cast by player&apos;s mounts triggered by script&quot;, makes the player cast the
              damaging spell on target with a small chance of failing it.

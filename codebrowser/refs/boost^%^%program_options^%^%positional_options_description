<doc f='include/boost/program_options/positional_options.hpp' l='21'>/** Describes positional options. 

        The class allows to guess option names for positional options, which
        are specified on the command line and are identified by the position.
        The class uses the information provided by the user to associate a name
        with every positional option, or tell that no name is known. 

        The primary assumption is that only the relative order of the
        positional options themselves matters, and that any interleaving
        ordinary options don&apos;t affect interpretation of positional options.
        
        The user initializes the class by specifying that first N positional 
        options should be given the name X1, following M options should be given 
        the name X2 and so on.

       *  This encapsulates the concept of a single bit.  An instance of this
       *  class is a proxy for an actual bit; this way the individual bit
       *  operations are done as faster word-size bitwise instructions.
       *
       *  Most users will never need to use this class directly; conversions
       *  to and from bool are automatic and should be transparent.  Overloaded
       *  operators help to preserve the illusion.
       *
       *  (On a typical system, this &lt;em&gt;bit %reference&lt;/em&gt; is 64
       *  times the size of an actual bit.  Ha.)

 * The context class represents internal zmq context and io threads.
 *
 * By default the context class will create one thread, however this can be
 * overridden in the constructor.
 *
 * The context class is the only object that can be considered thread safe.
 *
 * All sockets using endpoints other than inproc require the context to have
 * at least one thread.
 *
 * This class is c++0x move supporting and cannot be copied.

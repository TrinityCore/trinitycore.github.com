  // An escaped list is a super-set of what is commonly known as a comma
  // separated value (csv) list.It is separated into fields by a comma or
  // other character. If the delimiting character is inside quotes, then it is
  // counted as a regular character.To allow for embedded quotes in a field,
  // there can be escape sequences using the \ much like C.
  // The role of the comma, the quotation mark, and the escape
  // character (backslash \), can be assigned to other characters.</doc>

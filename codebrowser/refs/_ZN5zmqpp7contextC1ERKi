	 * Initialise the 0mq context.
	 *
	 * If only inproc is used then the context may be created with zero threads.
	 * Any inproc endpoint using sockets must be created using the same context.
	 *
	 * The context is thread safe an may be used anywhere in your application,
	 * however there is no requirement (other than inproc restrictions) for you
	 * to do this.
	 *
	 * \param threads an integer argument for the number of required threads. Defaults to 1.

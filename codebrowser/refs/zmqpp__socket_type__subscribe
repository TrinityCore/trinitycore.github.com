	 * \note It seems doxygen can&apos;t work out which data is for the socket type and
	 * which is for the socket option so both get listed for both.

	 * One to many - fair-queued.\n
	 * Connect to ::publish or ::xpublish.\n
	 * Socket is receive only.\n
	 * The \c subscribe socket can connection to any number of publishers and will
	 * fairly pull messages from each. The socket_option::subscribe settings can
	 * be use to limit which messages are received and by default none are.

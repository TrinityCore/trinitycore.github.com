   *  @brief  Container class for localization functionality.
   *  @ingroup locales
   *
   *  The locale class is first a class wrapper for C library locales.  It is
   *  also an extensible container for user-defined localization.  A locale is
   *  a collection of facets that implement various localization features such
   *  as money, time, and number printing.
   *
   *  Constructing C++ locales does not change the C library locale.
   *
   *  This library supports efficient construction and copying of locales
   *  through a reference counting implementation of the locale class.

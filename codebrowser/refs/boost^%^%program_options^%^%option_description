<doc f='include/boost/program_options/options_description.hpp' l='39'>/** Describes one possible command line/config file option. There are two
        kinds of properties of an option. First describe it syntactically and
        are used only to validate input. Second affect interpretation of the
        option, for example default value for it or function that should be
        called  when the value is finally known. Routines which perform parsing
        never use second kind of properties -- they are side effect free.

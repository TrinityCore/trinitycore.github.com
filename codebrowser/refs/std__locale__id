   *  @brief  Facet ID class.
   *  @ingroup locales
   *
   *  The ID class provides facets with an index used to identify them.
   *  Every facet class must define a public static member locale::id, or be
   *  derived from a facet that provides this member, otherwise the facet
   *  cannot be used in a locale.  The locale::id ensures that each class
   *  type gets a unique identifier.

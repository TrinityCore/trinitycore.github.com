 * Retrieve the parts of the 0mq version this library was built against.
 *
 * Because sections of the library are optionally compiled in or ignored
 * depending on the version of 0mq it was compiled against this method is
 * provided to allow sanity checking for usage.
 *
 * Set the three parameters to values representing the 0mq version number.
 * These values are generated at library compile time.
 *
 * \param major an unsigned 8 bit reference to set to the major version.
 * \param minor an unsigned 8 bit reference to set to the minor version.
 * \param revision an unsigned 8 bit reference to set the current revision.

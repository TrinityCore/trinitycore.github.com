  This structure is used to define bind information, and
  internally by the client library.
  Public members with their descriptions are listed below
  (conventionally `On input&apos; refers to the binds given to
  mysql_stmt_bind_param, `On output&apos; refers to the binds given
  to mysql_stmt_bind_result):

  buffer_type    - One of the MYSQL_* types, used to describe
                   the host language type of buffer.
                   On output: if column type is different from
                   buffer_type, column value is automatically converted
                   to buffer_type before it is stored in the buffer.
  buffer         - On input: points to the buffer with input data.
                   On output: points to the buffer capable to store
                   output data.
                   The type of memory pointed by buffer must correspond
                   to buffer_type. See the correspondence table in
                   the comment to mysql_stmt_bind_param.

  The two above members are mandatory for any kind of bind.

  buffer_length  - the length of the buffer. You don&apos;t have to set
                   it for any fixed length buffer: float, double,
                   int, etc. It must be set however for variable-length
                   types, such as BLOBs or STRINGs.

  length         - On input: in case when lengths of input values
                   are different for each execute, you can set this to
                   point at a variable containining value length. This
                   way the value length can be different in each execute.
                   If length is not NULL, buffer_length is not used.
                   Note, length can even point at buffer_length if
                   you keep bind structures around while fetching:
                   this way you can change buffer_length before
                   each execution, everything will work ok.
                   On output: if length is set, mysql_stmt_fetch will
                   write column length into it.

  is_null        - On input: points to a boolean variable that should
                   be set to TRUE for NULL values.
                   This member is useful only if your data may be
                   NULL in some but not all cases.
                   If your data is never NULL, is_null should be set to 0.
                   If your data is always NULL, set buffer_type
                   to MYSQL_TYPE_NULL, and is_null will not be used.

  is_unsigned    - On input: used to signify that values provided for one
                   of numeric types are unsigned.
                   On output describes signedness of the output buffer.
                   If, taking into account is_unsigned flag, column data
                   is out of range of the output buffer, data for this column
                   is regarded truncated. Note that this has no correspondence
                   to the sign of result set column, if you need to find it out
                   use mysql_stmt_result_metadata.
  error          - where to write a truncation error if it is present.
                   possible error value is:
                   0  no truncation
                   1  value is out of range or buffer is too small

  Please note that MYSQL_BIND also has internals members.

       *  This function erases all the elements located by the given key from
       *  a %set.
       *  Note that this function only erases the element, and that if
       *  the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched
       *  in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.

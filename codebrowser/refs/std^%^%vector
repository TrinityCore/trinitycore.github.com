   *  @brief  A specialization of vector for booleans which offers fixed time
   *  access to individual elements in any order.
   *
   *  @ingroup sequences
   *
   *  @tparam _Alloc  Allocator type.
   *
   *  Note that vector&lt;bool&gt; does not actually meet the requirements for being
   *  a container.  This is because the reference and pointer types are not
   *  really references and pointers to bool.  See DR96 for details.  @see
   *  vector for function documentation.
   *
   *  In some terminology a %vector can be described as a dynamic
   *  C-style array, it offers fast and efficient access to individual
   *  elements in any order and saves the user from worrying about
   *  memory and size allocation.  Subscripting ( @c [] ) access is
   *  also provided as with C-style arrays.

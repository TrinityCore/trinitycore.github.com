 * The socket class represents the zmq sockets.
 *
 * A socket can be bound and/or connected to as many endpoints as required
 * with the sole exception of a ::pair socket.
 *
 * The routing is handled by zmq based on the type set.
 *
 * The bound side of an inproc connection must occur first and inproc can only
 * connect to other inproc sockets of the same context.
 *
 * This class is c++0x move supporting and cannot be copied.

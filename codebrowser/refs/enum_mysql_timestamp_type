  Time declarations shared between the server and client API:
  you should not add anything to this header unless it&apos;s used
  (and hence should be visible) in mysql.h.
  If you&apos;re looking for a place to add new time-related declaration,
  it&apos;s most likely my_time.h. See also &quot;C API Handling of Date
  and Time Values&quot; chapter in documentation.

    Break-Shield spells can be classified in three groups:

        - Spells on vehicle bar used by players:
            + EFFECT_0: SCRIPT_EFFECT
            + EFFECT_1: NONE
            + EFFECT_2: NONE
        - Spells cast by players triggered by script:
            + EFFECT_0: SCHOOL_DAMAGE
            + EFFECT_1: SCRIPT_EFFECT
            + EFFECT_2: FORCE_CAST
        - Spells cast by NPCs on players:
            + EFFECT_0: SCHOOL_DAMAGE
            + EFFECT_1: SCRIPT_EFFECT
            + EFFECT_2: NONE

    In the following script we handle the SCRIPT_EFFECT for effIndex EFFECT_0 and EFFECT_1.
        - When handling EFFECT_0 we&apos;re in the &quot;Spells on vehicle bar used by players&quot; case
          and we&apos;ll trigger &quot;Spells cast by players triggered by script&quot;
        - When handling EFFECT_1 we&apos;re in the &quot;Spells cast by players triggered by script&quot;
          or &quot;Spells cast by NPCs on players&quot; so we&apos;ll search for the first defend layer and drop it.

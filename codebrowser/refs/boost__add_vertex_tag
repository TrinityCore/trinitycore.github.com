<doc f='include/boost/graph/graph_mutability_traits.hpp' l='18'>// The mutabiltiy categories classify graphs by their mutating operations
// on the edge and vertex sets. This is a substantially more refined
// categorization than the MutableGraph and MutablePropertyGraph denote.
// Currently, this framework is only used in the graph tests to help
// dispatch test to the correct places. However, there are probably some
// constructive or destructive algorithms (i.e., graph generators) that
// may use these to describe requirements on graph inputs.</doc>

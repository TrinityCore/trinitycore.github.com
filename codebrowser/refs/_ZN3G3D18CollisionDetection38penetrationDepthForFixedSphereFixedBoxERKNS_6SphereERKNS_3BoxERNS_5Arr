      Calculates the depth of penetration between a fixed sphere and a fixed
      box as well as the deepest point of the sphere that penetrates the box
      and the normal at that intersection.

      @note There are three possible intersections between a sphere and box.
      - Sphere completely contained in the box
      - Sphere intersects one edge
      - Sphere intersects one vertex

      The contact point and contact normal vary for each of these situations.
      - Sphere contained in Box:
         - Normal is based on side of least penetration (as is the depth calculation).
         - Point is based on center of sphere
      - Sphere intersects one edge
         - Normal is based on vector from the box center to the point of depth.
         - Point is closest point to the sphere on the line
      - Sphere intersects one vertex
         - Normal is based on vector from the box center to the vertex of penetration.
         - Point is vertex of penetration.

               objects then the depth will be a negative value.

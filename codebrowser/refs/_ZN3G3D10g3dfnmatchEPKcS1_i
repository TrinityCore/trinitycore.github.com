  Function fnmatch() as specified in POSIX 1003.2-1992, section B.6.
  Compares a filename or pathname to a pattern.

The fnmatch() function checks whether the string argument matches the pattern argument, which is a shell wildcard pattern.
The flags argument modifies the behaviour; it is the bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:

- FNM_NOESCAPE If this flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary character, instead of an escape character.
- FNM_PATHNAME If this flag is set, match a slash in string only with a slash in pattern and not by an asterisk (*) or a question mark (?) metacharacter, nor by a bracket expression ([]) containing a slash.
- FNM_PERIOD If this flag is set, a leading period in string has to be matched exactly by a period in pattern. A period is considered to be leading if it is the first character in string, or if both FNM_PATHNAME is set and the period immediately follows a slash.
- FNM_FILE_NAME This is a GNU synonym for FNM_PATHNAME.
- FNM_LEADING_DIR If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is considered to be matched if it matches an initial segment of string which is followed by a slash. This flag is mainly for the internal use of glibc and is only implemented in certain cases.
- FNM_CASEFOLD If this flag (a GNU extension) is set, the pattern is matched case-insensitively.

\return Zero if \a string matches \a pattern, FNM_NOMATCH if there is no match or another non-zero value if there is an error
